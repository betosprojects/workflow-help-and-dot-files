!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DELETE THIS AND AND ALL THE LINES UNDER HERE BEFORE INSTALLING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
// Remember to delete what you don't really need. Atom IDE is new to me, might not need the linters or give you warnings.

Run this on the terminal:
apm install --packages-file atom-package-list.txt

Or if you have Atom Beta:
apm-beta install --packages-file atom-package-list.txt
